This O(n^4) simulation shows an eye-catching manifestation of entropy in a system with only conservative forces. Bump the number of pendulums up to 30 and simulate for 3.00 seconds to see it in action. This mimics how large-scale, uniform motion in the real world disperses into chaotic motion on the molecular level.

Despite being a system of rigid bodies, it demonstrates the emergent property of elasticity. Set the number of pendulums to 10 and initial angular velocity to +1 rev/s counterclockwise. After 30 seconds, entropy overcomes an apparent elastic tension, compressing everything toward the center with high internal kinetic energy (thermal energy).

This is the browser version of the simulation. The mobile AR app is [AR MultiPendulum](https://github.com/philipturner/ar-multipendulum).
